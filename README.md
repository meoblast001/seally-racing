### Seally Racing ###

Seally Racing is a racing game in a 3D space with seals! This project targets
jMonkeyEngine 3 and is written in Java.

#### Gameplay

Fly around in a 3D space (under the sea, in the air, etc) and follow a course
marked by rings. Race your opponents and be the first to finish. Currently, the
plan is to make a single network multiplayer mode, but this plan is not
finalised.
